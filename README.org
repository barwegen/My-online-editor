* My online public editor

This repo is for getting text via a browser from any 
computer, e.g.  my mobile phone(s), now the blackberry 
key one and pinephone, to this directory.

I can use the org syntax (in stead of markdown) since 
github can render ('export') the .org syntax to html 
format, and githubs CSS, which is what you see right 
now.

This way I can;
- store my text documents as "plain text". 
- use version control with "git". 
- view private files online with github private repositories and 
- and "share" public files via github public repositories.
- edit these files on my pc or laptop with my preffered text editor which at the moment is [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

The README.org of this public github repository is my 
reference file for that.

Let's see how it works!


** Plain text markup 

Org mode effective plain-text markup language. 

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO 
lists, and project planning with a fast and effective 
plain-text markup language. 

All of this is achieved with strictly plain text 
files, the most portable and future-proof file format. 

Org runs in Emacs. Emacs is one of the most widely 
ported programs, so that Org mode is available on 
every major platform.


** Working with org syntax in Github

*** 1. Introduction

[[https://orgmode.org/org.html][org mode]]

****  1.1 Summary
Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO
lists, and project planning with a fast and 
effective plain-text markup language. It also is an 
authoring system with unique support for literate 
programming and reproducible research.

*** 2. Structure elements

**** 2.1 Headlines
Headlines define the structure of an outline tree. 
Org headlines start on the left margin3 with one or 
more stars followed by a space. For example:

: * Top level headline
: ** Second level
: *** Third level
:     some text
: *** Third level
:     more text
: * Another top level headline


**** 2.6 Lists 

1. groen
2. rood
3. blauw

**** 2.7 Drawers - ** This is a headline
Still outside the drawer
:DRAWERNAME:
This is inside the drawer.
:END:
After the drawer.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
** This is a headline
Still outside the drawer
:DRAWERNAME:
This is inside the drawer.
:END:
After the drawer.
 #+END_SRC

**** 2.8 Blocks

example block:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
,* I am no real headline
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or with semi colon at bol:
Here is an example
   : Some example from a text file.

source block in emacs lisp:
#+NAME: source block 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun org-xor (a b)
    "Exclusive or."
    (if a (not b) b))
 #+END_SRC

And a comment block:
#+NAME: comment block
#+BEGIN_COMMENT 
This is een comment.
#+END_COMMENT
